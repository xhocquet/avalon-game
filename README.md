## Tools
- [`SimMarkerNode`](client/Scripts/SimMarkerNode.cs) - Markers can be placed in Godot and used in sim code (spawns, shops)
  - These are baked with Godot tool [`GodotFPMapLayoutExporter`](client/Scripts/Editor/GodotFPMapLayoutExporter.cs) and saved to [`Sim/Data/MapLayout.bytes`](client/Sim/Data/MapLayout.bytes)
- In the same way, we generate a deterministic navmesh to [`NavigationRegion3D.NavMeshData.bytes`](client/Sim/Data/NavigationRegion3D.NavMeshData.bytes)
- [`UnitLookup`](sim/UnitLookup.cs) provides stable identifiers for all units, and resolves them back to entities

## Current Simulation Config

[`server/simulationconfig.json`](server/simulationconfig.json)

| `TickIntervalMs` | `66` | ~15 Hz (action 60 Hz, RTS 100 ms) |
| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| `InputDelayTicks` | `4` | Adds jitter slack without making command feel as heavy as the RTS guide's 6 tick baseline |
| `SDInputLeadTicks` | `4` | Gives clients enough lead time to reach the authoritative server. |
| `MaxRollbackTicks` | `8` | Just enough to smooth inputs |
| `SyncCheckInterval` | `4` | Fast desync detection |
| `UsePrediction` | `false` | Too expensive for many units |
| `EnableErrorCorrection` | `false` | Correct visible state > smoothing |
| `MaxEntities` | `1024+` | Gives us 4 players X 256 units. Room to grow |

## Todo

| Status | Work |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⬜ | Add event-driven audio reactions from synced events, not gameplay authority. |
| ⬜ | Add model/team tinting for structure views. |
| ⬜ | Branchless code — `math.select` instead of `if/else` for flow field generation (reported 10x speedup in RTS literature). |
| ⬜ | Multi-threaded A* — leverage 6-8 cores for parallel path queries. |
