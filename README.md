## Tools
- [`SimMarkerNode`](client/Scripts/SimMarkerNode.cs) - Markers can be placed in Godot and used in sim code (spawns, shops)
  - These are baked with Godot tool [`GodotFPMapLayoutExporter`](client/Scripts/Editor/GodotFPMapLayoutExporter.cs) and saved to [`Sim/Data/MapLayout.bytes`](client/Sim/Data/MapLayout.bytes)
- In the same way, we generate a deterministic navmesh to [`NavigationRegion3D.NavMeshData.bytes`](client/Sim/Data/NavigationRegion3D.NavMeshData.bytes)
- [`UnitLookup`](sim/UnitLookup.cs) provides stable identifiers for all units, and resolves them back to entities

### Dead code

- **[`Stats.Defense` and `Stats.Speed`](sim/Components/Stats.cs) (`:9-10`)** are never read anywhere in `sim/`, `client/`, `server/`, or `tests/`. They default to 100 and ride every rollback snapshot.
- **[`FlowFieldCache.Version` and `Invalidate()`](sim/Navigation/FlowFieldCache.cs)** are never called — meaning flow fields are never invalidated. Harmless while the navmesh is static, but the API implies otherwise.
- **[`Pickup.Type`](sim/Components/Pickup.cs)** is a commented-out field with a TODO.


  ## x
  Player and Hero are the same entity. HeroFactory adds both; nothing else ever adds Player. Systems pick
  whichever they feel like as the marker: DeathSystem excludes Player, RespawnSystem/ScoreSystem filter
  Player, HeroBehaviorSystem/TeamPruneSystem filter Hero, PickupSystem uses InventoryComponent,
  InventorySystem uses InventoryComponent + StatsComponent. Six spellings of one concept. The cheap fix is
  deleting Player and moving Score onto Hero; PlayerId is already on both.
